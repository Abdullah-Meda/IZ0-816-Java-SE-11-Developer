    /* The main purpose of a module is to provide groups of related packages to offer a particular set of
       functionality to developers. Itâ€™s like a JAR file except a developer chooses which packages are accessible
       outside the module

       The Java Platform Module System (JPMS) includes the following:
         - A format for module JAR files
         - Partitioning of the JDK into modules
         - Additional command-line options for Java tools */

    /* Benefits of Modules:
         - Better Access Control
         - Clearer Dependency Management
         - Custom Java Builds
         - Improved Performance
         - Unique Package Enforcement */
