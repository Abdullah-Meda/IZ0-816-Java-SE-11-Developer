    /* - PrintStream and PrintWriter are high‐level output print streams classes that are useful
         for writing text data to a stream.
       - Both classes have a lot of methods in common. However, when working with string data, you
         should use PrintWriter
       - Just remember that one operates on an OutputStream and the other a Writer
       - These two classes do not have corresponding input stream classes
       - Strangely, the PrintWriter class even has a constructor that takes an OutputStream as input
