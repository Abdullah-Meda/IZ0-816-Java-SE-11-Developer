      - All Streams             void close()                    Closes stream and releases resources
      - All Input Streams       int read()                      Reads a single byte or returns ‚Äê1 if no bytes were available
      - InputStream             int read(byte[] b)              Reads values into a buffer. Returns number of bytes read
      - Reader                  int read(char[] c)              Reads values into a buffer. Returns number of bytes read
      - InputStream             int read(byte[] b,              Reads up to length values into a buffer starting from position offset. Returns number of bytes read

      - Reader                  int read(char[] c,              Reads up to length values into a buffer starting from position offset. Returns number of bytes read
                                    int offset, int length)
      - All Output Streams      void write(int)                 Writes a single byte
      - OutputStream            void write(byte[] b)            Writes an array of values into the stream
      - Writer                  void write(char[] c)            Writes an array of values into the stream
      - OutputStream            void write(byte[] b,            Writes length values from an array into the stream, starting with an offset index
                                    int offset, int length)
      - Writer                  void write(char[] c,            Writes length values from an array into the stream, starting with an offset index
                                    int offset, int length)
      - All Input Streams       boolean markSupported()         Returns true if the stream class supports mark()
      - All Input Streams       mark(int readLimit)             Marks the current position in the stream
      - All Input Streams       void reset()                    Attempts to reset the stream to the mark() position
      - All Input Streams       long skip(long n)               Reads and discards a specified number of characters
      - All Input Streams       void flush()                    Flushes buffered data through the stream
